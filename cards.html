<h1>Your task:</h1>
<h2>Fork this codepen to your own account (or an anonymous account) and create an entire deck of cards based on the image below using CSS and JavaScript.<h2>
  <h3>The end result should be a function that generates 52 individual cards on the screen: 13 hearts, 13 spades, 13 diamonds, 13 clubs. You should generate the cards with JavaScript and add styles using CSS. You may use the Unicode characters: &spades;, &hearts;, &diams;, and &clubs;. The "face cards" (jack, queen, king, ace) do not need any special illustration on the body of the card but should be noted with the letter (as in the example). </h3>
  <h3>When complete, you should save the pen and email back a link to the URL where we can view your work. Code quality and self-documentation will be considered in our evaluation.</h3>
